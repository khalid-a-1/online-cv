    title: About me
    summary: |
      Growing up in Pakistan, an early lesson I was taught was that computer
      science is a man’s field. However, negative stereotyping did not impede
      my interest in the field. In fact, I grew more stubborn to become part of
      a field that was reluctant to admit me. So I started applying for my
      bachelor’s degree abroad to different countries where women had more autonomy
      and opportunities to navigate their field of choice. As soon as I received
      my merit-based scholarship from Denison, I flew halfway across the world to
      explore the marvels of computers. Since then, I have had rigorous courses
      involving building data structures, understanding the mathematical foundations
      of computer science, and working within computer systems. My hope is to
      graduate with my degree in computer science as a woman of color and have
      a career in a company where I can employ my skillset to better myself and
      those around me.
